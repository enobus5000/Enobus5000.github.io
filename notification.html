No R Cadio Podcast: Rotation Based Programming Schedule Effective Immediately
</strong><br /></h3>
<center><hr width="550" /></center>
<h3 align="justify">Effectively Immediately, the No C Radio Podcast is adopting a Rotation Based Programming Schedule. During the last few years of this podcast, many musicians and artists have submitted their material to be played right here on No C Radio. And these artists deserve a consistent platform for their music and voice to be heard on a whole different level. </h3>

<h3 align="justify">As most of us are familiar with standard terrestrial radio, their programming is a rotation format based on whether the artist receives light to heavy rotation on a daily basis. This format is very calculated and cookie-cutter due to a very limited library of music and being tied down to advertising revenue and other financial obligations. Many of the playlists on standard radio are antiquated, repetitive, and mundane.</h3>

<h3 align="justify">So welcome to a new form of rotation based scheduling where as more artists submit their creativity whether it be through music, voice, links to their creations, imaginations, art forms and the like, the rotation will only become bigger, wider, louder, and more creative than any sub-standard radio station could ever dream. This will also mean more exposure as new episodes are released. </h3>

<h3 align="justify">If you are an artist who currently has material here on the No C Radio Podcast, you will receive a notification saying you have been selected to be part of this rotation. Contact will come in the form of a link that, depending on what resource of contact (i.e. text, email), will repeat what I am telling you right here, right now. This will also include links on how to submit your creativity and talent to the podcast.
